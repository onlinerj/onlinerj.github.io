Hi, thank you for visiting!

This is **Rajat**. I am an ***AI research fellow*** and ***Generative AI lead*** with 6 Years of Experience in AI Research + Applied ML; 5x Azure Certified.

My interests lie in the field of **AI research and engineering**. Some research areas I have recently worked on include: **LLM Privacy and Security**, **Federated Learning** (Distributed Machine Learning), **RL / LLM Alignment**, **GPU Acceleration**, **Multi-Modal AI**, **Dissecting and Editing LLM architectures**, **Distributed LLM Training** and **LLM Security**.

During my **MS in Artificial Intelligence**, I have worked extensively with Research Labs, Professors, PhD students on multiple research areas in AI.
Before that, I led a team of people in the GenAI.

I overloaded my course credits and finished a 2 MS year course in 11 months all while maintining a perfect 4 GPA and also doing tons of publishable research!

I am a *positive-minded* and *highly optimistic* person. In my personal life, I have been a **travel and fitness enthusiast**—you can learn more about my adventures and personal challenges in the [Extracurricular Activities](/extracurricular/) section.
