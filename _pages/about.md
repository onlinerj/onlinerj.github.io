Hi, thank you for visiting!

This is **Rajat**. My interests lie in the field of **AI research and engineering**.

During my **MS in Artificial Intelligence**, I have worked extensively with Research Labs, Professors, and PhD students on multiple research areas in AI.

Some research areas I have recently worked on include: **LLM Privacy and Security**, **Federated Learning** (Distributed Machine Learning), **RL / LLM Alignment**, **GPU Acceleration**, **Multi-Modal AI**, **Dissecting and Editing LLM architectures**, **Distributed LLM Training**, and **LLM Security**.

Before that:
- I led a team of engineers at a GenAI startup.
- Lead team of engineers for production AI deployments for trillion dollar companies in energy sector.

I am a *positive-minded* and *highly optimistic* person. In my personal life, I have been a **travel and fitness enthusiast**.
